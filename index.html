				I’m Matt, founder of The Travel Blogs & that’s me on a little chair with a little beer. I created this site with the aim of making blogs for travel and posts from the best travel blogs easy to find.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				While travelling, I found it hard to find good travel blogs with posts about the places I wanted to visit. I would often find good travel bloggers, or posts about a place I wanted to visit, sometimes I got lucky, but often I was frustrated.<br><br>
